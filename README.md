# Image Processing Transformations

This repository contains implementations of various image processing techniques and transformations, organized by specific methods such as color space conversions, morphological operations, and more. Each transformation is documented with examples and applications.

## Convert to CMYK

Converts images from RGB to CMYK color space, which is often used in printing and provides color representation in terms of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. This conversion is essential for color consistency across different devices.

## Display Images from Folder

This section includes code to browse and display images from a specified folder. It helps visualize and select images for applying various transformations and provides a quick interface for managing large image datasets.

## Filters

Applies a range of filters to enhance or modify images, including Gaussian blur, edge detection, and sharpening. Filtering is fundamental in image processing for noise reduction, detail enhancement, and more.

## Fourier Transformation

Implements Fourier Transform to analyze and process image frequencies, useful for applications like image compression and signal processing. This section visualizes frequency components and applies low-pass or high-pass filtering.

## Histogram Equalization

Performs histogram equalization to improve image contrast. This technique redistributes image intensities for a more balanced contrast, often making details in darker or lighter images more visible.

## Hough Transform

Applies the Hough Transform technique to detect lines, circles, and other shapes within an image. It is commonly used in computer vision tasks for boundary detection and image segmentation.

## Laplace Transformation

Uses Laplacian filtering for edge detection, highlighting regions of rapid intensity change. The Laplacian operator is effective for identifying edges and is a core tool in feature extraction.

## Morphological Transformations

Applies morphological operations such as dilation, erosion, opening, and closing. These techniques are used for shape analysis, noise removal, and object segmentation, particularly in binary images.

## Gray, HSV, and CMYK Conversions

Includes transformations to convert images to grayscale, HSV, and CMYK color spaces. These conversions allow different color representations, useful for color analysis, segmentation, and preparing images for printing.

Each transformation is implemented with example images, making this repository a comprehensive guide to foundational image processing techniques and their practical applications.
